# E Commerce Sales Analysis

### Project Overview
---

This data analysis project aims to optimize sales performance for an e-commerce company by conducting a comprehensive analysis of 2023 sales data. By identifying key trends, patterns, and opportunities, the project will deliver actionable insights to drive revenue growth and enhance overall business strategy.

### Data Source

Sales Data: The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "sales_data.xlsx" file, which contains detailed information about each sale made by the company in different regions and states of the USA. 

### Tools

- Excel - Data preparation, analysis and dashboard report.


### Data Cleaning/Preparation

In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:
- Data loading and inspection.
- There were no missing values.
- Data cleaning and formatting.
- I created a new column called "Profit." I did this by subtracting the "shipping fee" from the "revenue."

### Exploratory Data Analysis

1. Top 5 products by category?
2. Top 5 products by region?
3. Lowest 2 products by region and category
4. Which products are the top sellers?

### Data Analysis
Excel Pivot Table is used in the analysis.

### Results

The analysis result are summarized as follows:

Beverages is the best performing in terms of category, followed by Dried fruit and Nuts. Others include sauces, jam, preserves and Candy.

In the regions, the top seller in the north is the curry sauce, south and west is the coffee while east is the marmalade.

Dried plums and green tea is the lowest product by category sold in the eastern, southern and western regions while Dried pears and green tea in the Northern region. 

The overall best seller by revenue is coffee.

The product category with good revenue in the regions should be targeted more for marketing efforts. The regions with low revenue generation, increased presence in those regions and customer centered marketing can help increase sales performance in those regions.

### Recommendations

Based on the analysis, we recommend the following actions:
1. Invest in marketing and promotions in those regions with low sales so as to maximize revenue. 
2. Focus on expanding and promoting products in Dried fruits and Nuts category.
3. Implement a customer segmentation strategy to target high-LIV customers effectively.
